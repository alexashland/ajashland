									</header>
									<p>This essay explores documentary literature as it emerged via the hybrid literary practices of the mid-nineteenth century. Turning to Harriet Beecher Stowe’s <i>A Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, I interrogate the document’s attachments to both civic and religious discourse. Stowe recognized facts and figures not as neutral data or irrefutable fact, but rather as powerfully situated phenomena. Indeed, part of what makes her <i>Key</i> such an important (though still critically underexamined) text is her belief that documents are socially embedded, politically contingent products of social discourse. Her assemblage of tables, figures, and texts reveals the “textuality” of documentary curation. The failure of objectivity in documentary genres such as census data, legal testimonies, and congressional transcripts suggests, for Stowe, that the boundaries separating fact from more “literary” expressions are neither as useful nor as productive as they once seemed. Ultimately, I argue that Stowe's documentary strategies were meant to inspire action by exposing the mechanisms that traditional literature sought to conceal.</p>

									</header>
									<p>Animation and interactivity are common strategies used to visualize and communicate spatiotemporal phenomena, but scholars remain skeptical as to the advantages these techniques afford users.  Research shows that, due to perceptual and cognitive limitations, animation and interactive design can actually interfere with comprehension and exploration of complex data.  This paper examines how or if language could resolve some of these issues, and provide a more meaningful user experience.  More specifically, I use data gathered from <i>The Walt Whitman Archive </i> to investigate the ways in which spatiotemporal phenomena and the complex systems that underlie them can benefit from incorporating existing scholarly narratives into their graphical display.  Correspondence networks are extraordinarily complicated systems, and while it is useful to animate the trajectory and transmission of sent and received messages, much important information is lost in the process.  My aim in this paper is partly to compare whether or not animated graphics are superior or inferior to informationally equivalent static graphics.  I also suggest a series of best practices for digital projects wherein editorial complements could be used to enhance existing animated displays.  I argue that narratives can improve users’ cognitive and perceptual awareness of social, historical, and contextual realities that remain implicit in data visualization.  The overall goal of my DH project, <i>Whitmap</i>, aims to help users discover thematic and historical patterns that may otherwise have remained hidden due to the cognitive or perceptual limitations that come with animation-only design.</p>

									<p>“This class has also made me more confident in my writing, I always enjoy feedback from my essays, some professors are sparing with their comments, but Professor Ashland always seemed to give good feedback that was actually beneficial and motivated me to fix the mistakes and grow as a writer.” (*)</p>
									<p>“If I had to answer the question, ‘What should be changed in this class’ I would honestly answer with nothing.  Dr. Alexander Ashland does a fantastic job making sure everyone understands the concepts and he is very organized and precise with his aim and objectives.” (*)</p>
									<header class="style1">
										<p align="left"><strong>Foundations of the English Major</strong></p>
									</header>
									<p>“Alex was amazing.  He was clear, knowledgeable, and helpful.  He always came prepared.”</p>
									<p>“I really enjoyed having Alex as my TA!  He was very fun and helpful, and if he didn’t known an answer (about material or course) he would look it up and email us very quickly.”</p>
									<p>“He was open  & inviting—I felt comfortable contacting him & my questions were always answered in a timely & respectful manner.”</p>
									<p>“He was always available to answer questions and responded promptly.  He created great discussions but also made class enjoyable.  He presented information clearly.” </p>
									<header class="style1">
										<p align="left"><strong>Rhetoric &#38; Composition I and II</strong></p>
									</header>
									<p>“Professor Ashland was a fantastic English professor.  I have always struggled with English, but Mr. Ashland has helped me improve my writing skills and feel more comfortable with my writing style.  His feedback on papers was good and it helped me to improve on later papers.  He was always available during office hours for any help that I needed.  Overall, he was a great teacher and I would definitely take him for another class.”</p>
									<p>“Professor Ashland was very helpful and made class interesting.  He did not lecture the entire time, but rather gave us time to work in groups and perform exercises to apply the material.  He was always available for help and replied to emails quickly.  When I was confused on the topic of the paper, he helped explain things better for me, and I thought that he was a fair grader.  He was consistent in his grading and left helpful comments on papers so I could understand what I could have changed.”</p>
									<p>“Mr. Ashland effectively taught the class.  I thought he did a great job of explaining what he wanted from his students in our essays and offered time outside of class to meet if we needed extra help.  In class discussions, I thought he did a good job of getting everyone to participate and voice their opinions.”</p>
									<p>“Mr. Ashland is an incredible instructor.  He is very friendly with his class and is always willing to help.  He provides great constructive criticism and knows what some of your best work is capable of.”</p>
									<p>“Professor Ashland made class very interesting and encouraged a learning environment where we helped our peers and felt comfortable helping them.”</p>

									<p>“Based on our discussions, I feel I have learned a nature way to construct my writing.  We did an activity that I wrote down as many things as possible in three minutes to help decide what the topic of a paper should be. It was really interesting and actually helped me narrow in to a topic that I could write a strong paper about.  I have more confidence about my research writing now.”</p>
									<p>“My instructor was really good and also very organized. He helped me work through my thought process whilst allowing me to grow in my creativity.”</p>
									<p>“My writing has definitely become more creative and expressive through the help of my instructor."</p>
